Today I kicked off devtober by setting up my project structure and github pages, along with that I wanted to verify that my engine build was working and godot-mono like I hoped (PS: an initial look verifies it in fact is not).

## What I Built
- github pages for my portfolio
- documented the last two days (up until 11:19AM Oct first).

## What I Learned
If I want the source code for godot-mono I need to look more into how to compile it.

## Tomorrow's Goals
- Next feature
